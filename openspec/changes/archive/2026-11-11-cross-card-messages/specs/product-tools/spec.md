# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Restricted board tool surface

The plugin SHALL expose tools for discovering Hubs, boards, and projects; reading board and task information; creating tasks; editing task titles and descriptions; creating, listing, and tag-aware updating of shared task notes; reading the transitions available from a task's current stage and recording the transition that task will follow next through `list_allowed_transitions` and `set_next_transition`; administering the boards of a Hub through `create_board`, `update_board`, `edit_board_yaml`, and `delete_board`, together with an extended `get_board_summary`; searching, reading, creating, editing, and deleting the Hub's team files through `search_team_files`, `read_team_file`, `create_team_file`, `edit_team_file`, and `delete_team_file`; and sending a message from a task conversation to another task in the same Hub through `send_task_message`. Its product tool surface SHALL NOT include moving tasks, deleting tasks, deleting notes, Hub creation, rename, or deletion, decision-ledger tools, or a plugin-owned TODO checklist. Recording a transition SHALL NOT be treated as moving a task.

#### Scenario: Discover available product operations

- **WHEN** an agent receives the plugin's board and note tools
- **THEN** Hub, board, and project discovery, board and task reading, task creation, task text editing, shared note creation, listing, and tag-aware updating, transition discovery and recording, board creation, board rename, board workflow reading and writing, empty-board deletion, team file search, reading, creation, editing, and deletion, and cross-card message sending are available operations
- **AND** board movement, task deletion, note deletion, Hub administration, decision-ledger operations, and a plugin-owned TODO checklist are not exposed as part of that tool surface

#### Scenario: Inspect the board administration tool names

- **WHEN** an agent receives the plugin's board administration tools
- **THEN** the surface contains `create_board`, `update_board`, `edit_board_yaml`, and `delete_board`
- **AND** no tool creates, renames, or deletes a Hub

#### Scenario: Do not move a task by recording a transition

- **WHEN** an agent records the transition a task will follow next
- **THEN** the task remains in its current stage and position
- **AND** the recorded transition only decides the destination of a later advance

#### Scenario: Expose team file operations

- **WHEN** an agent receives the plugin's product tools for a Hub bound to a storage that supports team files
- **THEN** searching, reading, creating, editing, and deleting the Hub's team files are available operations
- **AND** moving a team file to another path, restoring a deleted team file, and browsing the storage outside the team files directory are not exposed

#### Scenario: Expose the cross-card message tool

- **WHEN** an agent receives the plugin's product tools inside a task conversation
- **THEN** `send_task_message` is available as an operation
- **AND** the tool surface still exposes no moving or deleting of tasks and no Hub administration

### Requirement: Explicit user intent without a second product confirmation

Creating, editing, or deleting a task, creating, renaming, editing, or deleting a board, creating, editing, or deleting a Hub's team file, or sending a cross-card message through a product tool SHALL require an explicit user request for that change. The plugin SHALL NOT add another product-specific approval dialog for a write that the user explicitly requested. This requirement SHALL NOT bypass native DSH permission behavior.

#### Scenario: Create a task at the user's request

- **WHEN** the user explicitly asks an agent to create a task and the agent invokes the corresponding board operation
- **THEN** the requested task can be created without an additional product-specific confirmation dialog

#### Scenario: Edit a task at the user's request

- **WHEN** the user explicitly asks an agent to change a task's title or description and the agent invokes the corresponding board operation
- **THEN** the requested text change can be applied without an additional product-specific confirmation dialog

#### Scenario: Create a board at the user's request

- **WHEN** the user explicitly asks an agent to create a board in a Hub and the agent invokes `create_board`
- **THEN** the requested board can be created without an additional product-specific confirmation dialog

#### Scenario: Delete a board at the user's request

- **WHEN** the user explicitly asks an agent to delete an empty board and the agent invokes `delete_board` with confirmation
- **THEN** the requested board can be deleted without an additional product-specific confirmation dialog

#### Scenario: Do not use cards for unsolicited agent tracking

- **WHEN** an agent has no explicit user request to create, edit, or delete a board task or a board
- **THEN** the plugin's board tools do not authorize that change merely to track the agent's own work

#### Scenario: Edit a team file at the user's request

- **WHEN** the user explicitly asks an agent to change a document in the Hub's team files and the agent invokes the corresponding team file tool
- **THEN** the requested change can be applied without an additional product-specific confirmation dialog

#### Scenario: Do not use team files for unsolicited agent bookkeeping

- **WHEN** an agent has no explicit user request to create, edit, or delete a team file
- **THEN** the plugin's team file tools do not authorize that change merely to record the agent's own progress

#### Scenario: Send a cross-card message at the user's request

- **WHEN** the user explicitly asks an agent to send a message to another task and the agent invokes `send_task_message`
- **THEN** the requested message can be delivered without an additional product-specific confirmation dialog

#### Scenario: Do not message another card unsolicited

- **WHEN** an agent has no explicit user request to message another task
- **THEN** the plugin's cross-card message tool does not authorize that message merely to record the agent's own progress

### Requirement: Availability outside task-bound chats

Board and task read tools SHALL be available in task conversations and ordinary DSH chats. Creating or editing a task SHALL NOT require the calling chat to be associated with a task card. Board administration writes SHALL be available only in an ordinary DSH chat that is not owned by a task; a session owned by a task, including a subagent descendant of a task conversation, SHALL be rejected without changing board state. Board-scoped tools SHALL require an explicitly discovered board identifier in an ordinary DSH chat and SHALL resolve it from the task in a task conversation. Team file tools SHALL be available in task conversations and ordinary DSH chats alike, SHALL resolve the Hub from the task in a task conversation, and SHALL NOT require a board identifier or a task identifier. `send_task_message` SHALL be available only inside a conversation associated with a task. An ordinary DSH chat, a session that no task owns, and a subagent descendant of a task conversation SHALL be rejected with an actionable error without delivering anything.

#### Scenario: Use board tools from an ordinary DSH chat

- **WHEN** a user asks for a supported board operation in an ordinary DSH chat
- **THEN** the agent can discover a Hub and board with the approved tools
- **AND** it can perform the operation with the discovered board identifier without first opening or creating a task-bound conversation

#### Scenario: Use board tools from a task conversation

- **WHEN** a user asks for a supported board read operation within a task conversation
- **THEN** the same approved read operation set is available there
- **AND** the board identifier can be inferred from the task

#### Scenario: Reject board administration from a task conversation

- **WHEN** an agent invokes `create_board`, `update_board`, `edit_board_yaml`, or `delete_board` from a task conversation or from a subagent descendant of one
- **THEN** the tool rejects the request with an actionable error
- **AND** no board is created, changed, or deleted

#### Scenario: Do not require a board for Hub discovery

- **WHEN** an agent calls `list_hubs`
- **THEN** the tool returns the Hubs available to the installation
- **AND** it does not require a board or a native workspace

#### Scenario: Use team file tools from either conversation kind

- **WHEN** a user asks an agent to read or change a Hub's team file from a task conversation or from an ordinary DSH chat
- **THEN** the tool resolves the Hub for that conversation and reports the storage's team file support
- **AND** no board identifier or task identifier is required

#### Scenario: Reject a cross-card message outside a task conversation

- **WHEN** an agent invokes `send_task_message` from an ordinary DSH chat or from a session that no task owns
- **THEN** the tool rejects the request with an actionable error
- **AND** nothing is delivered

#### Scenario: Reject a cross-card message from a subagent descendant

- **WHEN** an agent invokes `send_task_message` from a subagent descendant of a task conversation
- **THEN** the tool rejects the request with an actionable error
- **AND** nothing is delivered
