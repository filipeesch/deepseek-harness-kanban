## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Run a stage instruction from a card

When a task's current stage has an entry instruction, its card SHALL expose a run action only while the current entry into that stage is unresolved. The entry SHALL be unresolved when a persisted entry marker exists for the current stage and no successful user prompt has been sent in any open conversation of the task since that entry. The marker SHALL be created on every move into an instructed stage, including a task created directly in an instructed initial stage. A same-stage reorder SHALL NOT reset the marker; leaving and re-entering the stage SHALL create a new marker. A successful user prompt in any open conversation SHALL clear the marker, and a successful stage-instruction delivery for that entry SHALL clear it as well. An admission failure SHALL NOT clear it. A task already in an instructed stage without a marker SHALL NOT show the action until its next entry. While the timed instruction for the entry is counting down or being sent, the card SHALL expose the countdown control defined by the Timed stage instruction after a move requirement instead of the run action; canceling that countdown or a failed timed send SHALL expose the run action for the same unresolved entry. When visible, the action SHALL deliver the stage's entry instruction to the task's first open conversation in conversation order as the stage-instruction context message defined by Stage instruction delivery as context in `task-conversations`, followed by the transition briefing defined by Transition briefing for an instructed stage when that briefing applies. When the task has no conversation, activating the action SHALL first present the execution preparation defined by Execution preparation before a task's first execution; when no conversation is open after the preparation, the action SHALL create a new conversation and use that conversation as the target. The action SHALL carry the entry identity it was displayed for — the entry's stage and entry timestamp — and the host SHALL reject a request for an entry that has been resolved or replaced. The action SHALL NOT move the task or change its position, SHALL NOT offer a conversation picker, and SHALL NOT be available in selection mode. It SHALL be unavailable while the task has an unresolved context operation or confirmed transition. The delivered context message SHALL contain the stage instruction and, when it applies, the transition briefing; the conversation's first-turn task context supplies the task context. Admission failures SHALL be reported without changing the stage or position and without creating another conversation beyond the resolved target.

#### Scenario: Show the action after a transition

- **AND** the task is not moved by the action

#### Scenario: Existing task without an entry marker

- **WHEN** a task is already in an instructed stage without an entry marker
- **THEN** the card does not expose the run action
- **AND** the action becomes available only after its next entry

#### Scenario: Run an instruction from a card

- **WHEN** the user activates the run action on a card whose stage has an entry instruction and whose first conversation is open
- **THEN** the stage instruction is delivered to that first open conversation as a stage-instruction context message
- **AND** no user message records the instruction
- **AND** the task's stage and position are unchanged
- **AND** no conversation picker is presented

#### Scenario: Include the transition briefing

- **WHEN** the user activates the run action on a card whose stage configures two or more targets
- **THEN** the delivered context message contains the stage instruction followed by the transition briefing

#### Scenario: Prepare the first run from a card

- **WHEN** the user activates the run action on a card whose task has no conversation
- **THEN** the execution preparation is presented before a conversation is created or the instruction is admitted
- **AND** after the preparation the instruction is delivered to the conversation created by it
- **AND** the task's stage and position are unchanged

#### Scenario: Run the instruction again

- **WHEN** a stage instruction has already been admitted and the card later re-enters that instructed stage
- **THEN** a new unresolved entry is created
- **AND** the action is available and sends the current stage instruction again to the resolved target

#### Scenario: Run when every conversation is closed

- **WHEN** the user activates the run action and every task conversation is closed
- **THEN** a new conversation is created and becomes the target

- **AND** no instruction is sent
- **AND** the task's stage, position, and conversations are unchanged

#### Scenario: Action unavailable while the task is busy

- **WHEN** the task has an unresolved context operation, a confirmed transition, or selection mode is active
- **THEN** the run action is unavailable
- **AND** no instruction is sent

#### Scenario: No action without an entry instruction

- **WHEN** a card's current stage has no entry instruction
- **THEN** the card does not expose the run action

### Requirement: Timed stage instruction after a move
When a permitted move changes a task's stage to a stage with an entry instruction, or a task created directly in an instructed initial stage completes the automatic first-execution preparation defined by Automatic first execution on task creation, the system SHALL arm one five-second countdown for that entry. The countdown SHALL be armed for board drops, drawer stage changes, and the automatic creation preparation. It SHALL NOT be armed for a same-stage reorder, for a creation whose Start execution now option is disabled, or for a move into a stage without an entry instruction. When the task has no conversation, the countdown SHALL be armed only after the first-execution preparation (the interactive preparation defined by Execution preparation before a task's first execution or the automatic creation preparation) completes, and the conversation that preparation created SHALL be the target. The target SHALL be the task's first open conversation in conversation order; when no conversation is open, the system SHALL create a new conversation and use it. When the five seconds elapse without cancellation, the system SHALL deliver only that stage's entry instruction to the target as the stage-instruction context message defined by Stage instruction delivery as context in `task-conversations`, followed by the transition briefing defined by Transition briefing for an instructed stage when that briefing applies. Cancel SHALL stop only the automatic send: the task's stage, position, and unresolved entry SHALL remain, and the card's run action SHALL be available. A new instructed entry for the task SHALL replace the pending countdown for the previous entry. The countdown SHALL be canceled without sending when a successful user prompt resolves the entry, when the task is deleted, or when the entry marker is removed for any other reason. The card SHALL present the countdown as a control that cancels when activated. The drawer for the task SHALL present a matching countdown notice above its section panel with the same cancel action. Both notices SHALL identify the stage whose instruction will run. A countdown SHALL continue when its card is not rendered, when the Kanban panel is not visible, or when the user switches to another board or Hub. The automatic send SHALL NOT depend on the board that armed it being mounted or visible. Unsent composer text or attachments in the target conversation SHALL NOT prevent the send and SHALL remain unchanged. The countdown SHALL NOT be persisted: a reload or plugin restart SHALL send nothing and SHALL leave the entry unresolved with its run action available. A failed timed delivery SHALL stop the countdown, report the failure on the card and in the drawer notice, restore the run action for the unresolved entry, and SHALL NOT retry automatically. When admission reports that the entry was already resolved, the countdown SHALL end without reporting a failure. The delay SHALL be fixed at five seconds and SHALL NOT be configurable.

- **AND** the card exposes the countdown control for the same entry

#### Scenario: Arm after the first-execution preparation
- **WHEN** a task without a conversation is dropped on a permitted stage with an entry instruction and the execution preparation completes
- **THEN** the countdown for that entry is armed only after the preparation
- **AND** the target is the conversation created by the preparation

#### Scenario: Arm after the creation preparation
- **WHEN** a task is created directly in an instructed initial stage with Start execution now enabled and the automatic first-execution preparation completes

- **AND** the card exposes the run action for the unresolved entry

#### Scenario: Manual prompt cancels the countdown
- **WHEN** a successful user prompt resolves the entry before the countdown ends

#### Scenario: New instructed entry replaces the countdown
- **WHEN** the task moves again into another instructed stage before the countdown ends

- **THEN** no instruction is sent automatically
- **AND** the entry remains unresolved
- **AND** the card exposes the run action after reload

### Requirement: Pending user work
Pending user work SHALL mean any input a task's conversation still owes the user's counterpart: an unanswered structured question round, an unanswered native question, a pending approval or permission request, and a user message queued for the next turn. Pending user work SHALL be evaluated for every conversation of the task, including a conversation whose tab is closed and a conversation the client has never displayed. A stage-instruction message the host delivered to a conversation SHALL NOT count as pending user work: it carries a plugin source instead of a user source, so it is never input the user owes the task.

Pending user work SHALL be derived from the conversations' durable state and SHALL NOT be persisted with the task, so it cannot outlive the input it describes. Submitting a structured question round, answering with an ordinary chat reply, answering a native question, deciding an approval, or losing a queued message SHALL consume the corresponding item. An unreadable conversation state SHALL NOT be treated as idle: the host SHALL NOT admit an advance from that evaluation and SHALL report the failure. The auto-mode control MAY keep its previous state, because an unreadable state cannot be presented as a specific kind of pending work.

#### Scenario: An unanswered question round is pending
- **WHEN** a conversation of the task has a structured question round with no answer
- **THEN** the task has pending user work

#### Scenario: An unanswered native question is pending
- **WHEN** a conversation of the task has a native question awaiting the user
- **THEN** the task has pending user work

#### Scenario: A pending approval is pending
- **WHEN** a conversation of the task has an approval or permission request awaiting the user
- **THEN** the task has pending user work

#### Scenario: A queued user message is pending
- **WHEN** a conversation of the task holds a user message queued for the next turn
- **THEN** the task has pending user work

#### Scenario: A closed conversation still counts
- **WHEN** a conversation with pending user work has its tab closed
- **THEN** the task still has pending user work

#### Scenario: A host-queued stage instruction is not user work
- **WHEN** the only queued message in a conversation is a stage instruction the host queued itself
- **THEN** the task does not have pending user work because of that message
- **AND** the classification follows from the message source rather than from a plugin-side record of prompts the host admitted

#### Scenario: Consuming the last item ends the pending state
- **WHEN** the last outstanding item of pending user work in the task is consumed
- **THEN** the task no longer has pending user work
- **AND** no stored record had to be cleared

#### Scenario: Unreadable state is not idle
- **WHEN** a conversation's state cannot be read while pending user work is being evaluated
- **THEN** no automatic advance is admitted for that evaluation
- **AND** the failure is reported
- **AND** the control is not required to present a pending-work kind for it

### Requirement: Automatic advance destination and dispatch

The automatic advance destination SHALL be the stage of the task's recorded transition for its current stage while that transition resolves. Otherwise it SHALL be the first entry of the current stage's configured transitions, or the stage that follows the current stage in workflow order when the stage does not configure transitions. There SHALL be no default destination when the configured list is empty or the resolved stage is the current stage.

When the destination is the recorded transition, the advance SHALL move the task exactly to that stage and SHALL NOT continue resolution beyond it. While the default destination has no entry instruction, resolution SHALL continue from that destination. Resolution SHALL stop at the first stage that has an entry instruction, or at the last reachable stage when no reachable stage has one. A stage already visited during the same resolution SHALL NOT be revisited. The resolved destination and its entry instruction SHALL be captured when the advance is admitted, so a workflow edit after admission SHALL NOT change that advance.

A recorded transition that no longer resolves SHALL NOT be replaced by the default destination. The host SHALL NOT advance the task and SHALL pause auto mode with the `transition-stale` reason defined by Auto mode on a task card.

The task SHALL be placed at the top of the destination stage, before every card that stage already contains. When the destination has an entry instruction, that instruction SHALL be delivered to the task's first open conversation as the stage-instruction context message defined by Stage instruction delivery as context in `task-conversations`, followed by the transition briefing defined by Transition briefing for an instructed stage when that briefing applies; when no conversation is open, a new conversation SHALL be created and used as the target. The delivered context message SHALL contain the stage instruction and, when it applies, the briefing. The advance SHALL NOT create more than one conversation beyond that target. The destination entry SHALL remain unresolved until a prompt or a stage instruction is delivered.

#### Scenario: Use the recorded transition

- **WHEN** the current stage configures multiple permitted transitions, the task recorded one of them, and a completed turn advances the task
- **THEN** the task moves to the stage of the recorded transition

#### Scenario: Stop at the recorded destination

- **WHEN** the recorded transition names a stage without an entry instruction and a later reachable stage has one
- **THEN** the task moves exactly to the recorded stage
- **AND** no later stage is crossed and no instruction is sent

#### Scenario: Pause on a recorded transition that no longer resolves

- **WHEN** a completed turn would advance a task whose recorded transition is no longer a configured target of its current stage
- **THEN** no advance is admitted
- **AND** auto mode is paused with the `transition-stale` reason
- **AND** the task remains in its current stage

#### Scenario: Use the first configured transition

- **WHEN** the current stage configures multiple permitted transitions, no transition is recorded, and a completed turn advances the task
- **THEN** the task moves to the first configured transition's stage

#### Scenario: Fall back to workflow order

- **WHEN** the current stage does not configure transitions and a completed turn advances the task
- **THEN** the task moves to the next stage in workflow order

#### Scenario: Cross a stage without an instruction

- **WHEN** the next stage has no entry instruction and a later reachable stage has one
- **THEN** the task moves to that later stage in one advance
- **AND** that stage's instruction is delivered

#### Scenario: Stop at the last reachable stage

- **WHEN** no reachable stage ahead has an entry instruction
- **THEN** the task moves to the last reachable stage
- **AND** no instruction is sent

#### Scenario: Place at the top of the destination

- **WHEN** an advance is dispatched to a destination stage that already contains tasks
- **THEN** the task is placed before every existing card of that stage
- **AND** the existing cards retain their relative order

#### Scenario: Never revisit a stage

- **WHEN** the resolution would return to a stage it already visited
- **THEN** resolution stops before the repeat
- **AND** no advance loops

#### Scenario: Capture the instruction at admission

- **WHEN** the destination instruction changes after an advance is admitted
- **THEN** the admitted advance sends the captured instruction
- **AND** the task moves to the captured destination

#### Scenario: Target the first open conversation

- **WHEN** an advance with an instructed destination is dispatched and the task has open conversations
- **THEN** the first open conversation receives the instruction
- **AND** no conversation picker is presented

#### Scenario: Create the target conversation

- **WHEN** an advance with an instructed destination is dispatched and the task has no open conversation
- **THEN** one new conversation is created and receives the instruction
- **AND** no additional conversation is created

#### Scenario: Keep a failed destination entry unresolved

- **WHEN** the instruction cannot be delivered after the task moved
- **THEN** the task stays in the destination
- **AND** the destination entry remains unresolved
- **AND** the card exposes the stage run action for that entry

### Requirement: Transition briefing for an instructed stage

When a stage configures two or more transition targets and the host delivers that stage's entry instruction, the delivery SHALL include a host-generated briefing after the instruction. The briefing SHALL list every configured target with its stage name and its authored condition when the stage authored one, SHALL name the recorded transition when the task already recorded one for that stage, SHALL name the target that applies when nothing is recorded, and SHALL name the tool that records the choice. The briefing SHALL be derived from the active workflow at the moment of delivery and SHALL appear on every delivery path: the card run action, the timed stage instruction after a move, a confirmed transition, the automatic advance, and the first execution of a task created by an agent. A stage that configures fewer than two targets SHALL produce no briefing, and its context message SHALL contain only the entry instruction.

#### Scenario: Include the briefing with two or more targets

- **WHEN** the host delivers the entry instruction of a stage that configures two or more targets
- **THEN** the delivered context message contains the instruction followed by the transition briefing

#### Scenario: Omit the briefing with one target

- **WHEN** the host delivers the entry instruction of a stage that configures exactly one target
- **THEN** the delivered context message contains only the entry instruction

#### Scenario: Omit the briefing without configured transitions

- **WHEN** the host delivers the entry instruction of a stage that does not configure transitions
- **THEN** the delivered context message contains only the entry instruction

#### Scenario: List each target with its condition

- **WHEN** the briefing is generated for a stage whose targets carry authored conditions
- **THEN** every target is listed with its stage name and its condition
- **AND** a target without a condition is listed without one

#### Scenario: Name the target that applies without a recording

- **WHEN** the briefing is generated and the task has no recorded transition for that stage
- **THEN** the briefing names the target the host uses when nothing is recorded

#### Scenario: Name the recorded transition

- **WHEN** the briefing is generated and the task already recorded a transition for that stage
- **THEN** the briefing names the recorded transition

#### Scenario: Derive the briefing at send time

- **WHEN** the workflow changes between the admission of an instruction and its delivery
- **THEN** the briefing reflects the targets the stage configures at the moment of delivery

#### Scenario: Include the briefing on every send path

- **WHEN** a stage instruction is delivered by the card run action, the timed stage instruction after a move, a confirmed transition, the automatic advance, or the first execution of a task created by an agent
- **THEN** the delivered context message includes the briefing whenever the stage configures two or more targets
